So I call it Mario. If you have a melody of the theme in your head, you can try to play those notes on drums with the metronome.

So I call it Mario. If you have a melody of the theme in your head, you can try to play those notes on drums with the metronome. I just play each note as a hit of different dynamics. My left hand can barely hold 80bpm. I've also got the internet today, and just allowed myself to type in Mario theme in youtube, and here is a 1 hour theme set. It seems to be pretty fun, high bpm though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"&gt;&lt;iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ijDdxmoiX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Sad note</title><description>&lt;p&gt;My phone made this picture.

Not perpetuating any bad mood, just looking as clear as I can at my life. I'm not going in any particular direction as far as any business or a job. It is kind of depressing. Since I see no point there. I was playing guitar in a covered walkway above the railway tracks recently. Did not have the strength to sing loud. So I just kept trying to improvise or play something Phrygian to fill the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mushrooms</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to go search some mushrooms, since I should prove my basic survival skills talents.

Just kidding. I had nothing substantial to eat today. But this red phallic mushroom was very interesting. I think I've read about it somewhere but forgot its name. Probably Devils finger or something like that. Another interesting one is this sun shaped:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/leokov/image/upload/q_auto/v1/powerhouse-images/IMG_4125.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a place with a lot of birds bones. I thought it was some bird eater's lair. For some reason I made no pictures of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I encountered someones hut deep in the forest. It looked more like a land of several hut buildings. I decided not to make a visit. Just went to gather mushrooms as the sun was going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I was looking down all the way, so I have not noticed how got into some closed area. There was an abandoned bunker or something like that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/leokov/image/upload/q_auto/v1/powerhouse-images/IMG_4126.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/leokov/image/upload/q_auto/v1/powerhouse-images/IMG_4127.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Mushrooms"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Want to come in?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not coming in. Just going further and getting out of this area through the weakness in a spiky fence. Looks like this place been long forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://res-2.cloudinary.com/leokov/image/upload/q_auto/v1/powerhouse-images/IMG_4129.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got a lot of brown cap boletuses from the lair, quite a lot of oilers from the bunker area. It got dark, and I went to the car.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Titled</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I used to update this website, trying to make those pictures showing up on mobile Safari.

I tried to record a voice for this track again and again. I was invited to the birthday party. But some people are also supposed to be there, whom I may know. So I'm confused and don't want anything new. Being around people is difficult at times like this. Was asked to come, but want to say no. May be I should isolate and practice some confidence. But as the day goes I feel a bit better. So I decided to make a short visit and swam ahead like a leaky boat. I came when everyone started to leave. I'm not sure why. But does it matter. Just tried to record a voice for this track again and again ..&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I'm tired</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is what you probably do not want to hear from me.

But anyway, this is a text dump on the outskirts of life. I write whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel tired, especially at the first half of the day. This can manifest in the lack of energy, no purpose, and all those kinds of things, they call a depression. This is true. I think it is a scourge of our time. I don't know, may be it is my own bubble, but some people told me they suffer from it. Practically most of the people I have a contact with have those kind of issues. And I think it is deep enough. You can admit it. But there are so many things today you can compensate with. I probably had it forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Experimenting</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Alright. This is my first message. I'm sitting in a minivan.
