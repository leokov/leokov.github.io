I tried to record a voice for this track again and again. I was invited to the birthday party. But some people are also supposed to be there, whom I may know. So I'm confused and don't want anything new. Being around people is difficult at times like this. Was asked to come, but want to say no. May be I should isolate and practice some confidence. But as the day goes I feel a bit better. So I decided to make a short visit and swam ahead like a leaky boat. I came when everyone started to leave. I'm not sure why. But does it matter. Just tried to record a voice for this track again and again ..&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>I'm tired</title><description>&lt;p&gt;This is what you probably do not want to hear from me.

But anyway, this is a text dump on the outskirts of life. I write whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel tired, especially at the first half of the day. This can manifest in the lack of energy, no purpose, and all those kinds of things, they call a depression. This is true. I think it is a scourge of our time. I don't know, may be it is my own bubble, but some people told me they suffer from it. Practically most of the people I have a contact with have those kind of issues. And I think it is deep enough. You can admit it. But there are so many things today you can compensate with. I probably had it forever.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Experimenting</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Alright. This is my first message. I'm sitting in a minivan.
